## What was learned by creating PortoPhoto:

1. Learned quite a bit of front-end development in regards to JavaScript and how it communicates; DOM events were used tremendously for selecting elements and manipulating their actions on a page. Utilized the DOM methods .addEventListener(), .querySelector(), .querySelectorAll(), .addAttribute(), .getAttribute(), .getElementsByTagName(), .innerHTML/.outerHTML just to name a few. 
2. Continued to expand on current knowledge of how HTML/CSS works. Learned a bit more about organization of tags, and the use of class names/ID names as well as the importance of choosing good names for the aformentioned attributes. 
3. Learned how touch events work for mobile, which branched off to dynamically changing the CSS styles of elements.
4. Delved into iteration a bit more; created a much more refined and improved understanding of how the concept can be used for web development.
5. Used the Array data type to manage elements from the DOM and variables created within the JavaScript files. Elaborated and studied how the following Array methods can be used: .length, .prototype, .slice() and .slice.call(), .forEach(), .indexOf()
6. Learned about how .classList can be used with it's respective methods. To highlight a few that were helpful: .add(), .remove(), .toggle()
7. Embedded by variables into Object notation to prevent future errors and to make code cleaner.
8. Learned how to reduce file sizes of large .JPG images.
9. Added in depth comments for each JavaScript file. Explained the job of each variable, what their purpose were for, how the code functioned, and why the code was necessary. (Old code is also included to see the improvements that were implemented)
